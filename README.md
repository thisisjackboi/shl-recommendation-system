SHL Assessment Recommendation System
📖 Overview
This project implements a recommendation system specifically designed for suggesting SHL assessments based on user-provided job descriptions or query terms. The core functionality involves embedding-based semantic similarity computations and evaluation using precision and recall metrics.

🚀 Features
Semantic Recommendation: Provides relevant SHL assessments based on user input.

Embedding Support: Uses modern NLP embedding techniques.

API Integration: Offers recommendations through a REST API.

Evaluation Metrics: Calculates Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Recall for accuracy measurement.

Interactive Frontend: Modern and intuitive web interface with dynamic search capabilities and theme toggles.

🛠 Installation & Setup
Step 1: Clone Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shl-recommender.git
cd shl-recommender
Step 2: Setup Python Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment (venv or conda):

Using venv:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Create a requirements.txt with necessary libraries or directly install via:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn flask beautifulsoup4 requests
▶️ Running the Application
Start the API server
bash
Copy
Edit
python api.py
API will be available at http://localhost:5000

Accessing the Frontend
Open templates/index.html directly in your browser, or serve using a simple HTTP server:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Python simple server
python -m http.server 8000
Then access at http://localhost:8000/templates/index.html

            "Test Type": "Knowledge & Skills",
            "Score": 0.87
        },
        ...
    ]
}
🧪 Evaluation Metrics
Run evaluation script to test recommendation performance:

bash
Copy
Edit
python evaluation.py
Outputs Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Recall values.

Useful for performance benchmarking and ensuring recommendation accuracy.
